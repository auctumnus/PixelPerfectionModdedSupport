# Supported mods

As mods get more support, they'll be added here. Mod support is on a scale of 0-5.

- [Quark by Vazkii](https://quark.vazkii.net/) - 1 (chests done, planning to get most of it supported; you should probably turn off variant mobs since they conflict with Pixel Perfection's!)
- [Macaw's Furniture](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/macaws-furniture) - 5
- [AppleSkin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/appleskin) - 5
