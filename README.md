# Pixel Perfection Modded Support
This is a version of [Pixel Perfection Community Edition](https://github.com/auctumnus/PixelPerfectionCE) with support for various mods. At the moment, mod support is limited. A list of supported mods can be found in SUPPORTED.md. 

## Installation
Updating this pack for every installation of Minecraft would suck a lot, so the way I personally handle it is symlinking them:
```sh
cd resourcepacks
ln -s /path/to/PixelPerfectionModdedSupport ./PixelPerfectionModdedSupport
```
This way you only have to have one copy of the resource pack, and it'll update whenever you `git pull`.

## Contributing
Open a pull request! More than likely, it'll be accepted, as long as your work doesn't have any license issues. Please give credit where needed! I really don't want to have to sort out licensing issues myself.

### Contributors

## Requesting mods to be supported
Note that mods will largely be added whenever I personally want it. However, you can request mods to be added by opening an issue using the "Mod request" template. 

## License
CC-BY-SA 4.0 - see LICENSE.md. As more mods are added, other licenses may need to be added for their content specifically, but rest assured that giving credit and linking back will usually protect you.
